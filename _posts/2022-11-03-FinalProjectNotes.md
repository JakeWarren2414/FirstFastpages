## Computer Science

- Striver is a social media website that allows people to like posts that other users posted. On the website the user can make a post and talk about anything on it. It also has an inspirational quote generator that uses an API to fetch data on random quotes
- Quinn Eliabeth was an online shopping website. Its frontend was amazing. You could pick pieces of clothing and add them to cart. It adds to your overall price. 
- Scheduler was a website that allowed you to add events to a calender. It also used an API to fetch weather data. You input a city and it gives you the weather of that city. 

## Computer Animation

- Computer animation was a great experience. Stundets created a whole entire 3D virtual wrold. There was donuts, tables, and walls in the one I looked at. It looked as if a cartoon could have been developed from this. 

## Ceramics

- I was in ceramics last year and I have it second trimester this year. It was a very fun class and this night reminded me of that. The stuents created great projects. 

## Drawing and Painting

- Drawing and painting is not my strong suit. This is why I think it is so much more impressive what some of these studetns are able to accomplish. There were many different great drawings. There were realistics portraits as well as creative chaos.
