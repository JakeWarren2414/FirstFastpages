<li>There are closed and open source licenses. Closed means not open to public and open are. </li>
<li>In closed you have to credit the original authors. </li>
<li>GPL is open and it deosn't allow closed versions of itself to be made</li>
<li>Both are great but have different uses</li>
<li>Can be helpful for sharing software. In Github we often reuse code such as themes so the license gives credit to it. Makes it free of charge for the user</li>
<li>There are many differetn types</li>

<li>Copyright can be dangerous. Many people use it for their own gain at expense of others. It takes other people work and doesn't give them credit meaning they lose money. </li>
<li>License helps keep copyright away by claiming a product. </li>
<li>We can use liscenses on Github to claim our own work. </li>
<li>It is not easy to detest if someone stole your liscense however. </li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>I feel like we should be more careful about PII. If we reveal too much information soemone could take our identity, attack us, or use that information for bad puroses. Of course things like name, country, and credit reports aren't too bad. However, once we give away more personal information such as drivers license number, SS number, and names of reletives it can be dangerous. </li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>A good password would be a name of a pet followed by some number that is personal to you and only you know such as Sammy2414. A bad password would be one that is easily guessed such as 12345678, or one that has accesible information about you such as your instagram username. </li>

<li>Symmetric encrption is where you only use one key like a password to detec some sort of information. Aysmmeric is where you use two, one public and one private like a username and password. </li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>A phishing scheme I have learned is people pretending to be some official such as a member of a credit card company to achieve sensetive information. I have also seen people send a link that when clicked gives information. Finally I have also seen people make websites that require inforation to sign up and it takes that information. </li>
