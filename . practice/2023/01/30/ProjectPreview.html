<li>I will be using the "Sports Quiz" portion of our fitness website for my CPT project. It asks a series of questions to the user based on their personality. "Do you like to play sports with balls" for example. Based on these results, it will chose the best possible sport for the user.

<ul>
<li>I plan to code the question asking by making a table with the question and a yes/no button. When the either button is clicked I will have it change a variable to true or false. "Do you like to play sports with balls?" could be asked and if the user selects "yes" it will change the variable "ball" to true. This process is then repeated for every question. Also when a button is clicked it will hide the current row of the table and then reveal the next question and eventually the final sport. I will calculate the final sport by conditions and "and" statements. Every result will have its own combination of "ands" for the bariables. For example, "ball", "contact", and "outside" are all variables for a certain question. If they are all true then there will only be one if statement triggered. This if statements result will reveal a sport, a paragraph about the sport, an image of the sport, and a retry quiz button.<br>

<li>In this video I will first answer all of the question randomly and a sport will be shown. Then I will retry the quiz with different questions and show a different sport. </li>
