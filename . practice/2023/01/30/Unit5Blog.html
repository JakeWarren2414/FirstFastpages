<ul>
<li>The first is making working out much more simple. Instead of the user researching about a million different foods and workouts, we ask them questions based on what their goals, plans, and body type are. Then we compile it into a small amount of digesable information they can easily use. </li>
<li>The second effect is helping them reach their goals and track their progress. Thanks to our presentations on Friday, Mr.Mort said we should add a goal system for amount of workouts completed. This helps the user stay on track. </li>
<li>The final effect of our website is to inform the user about gyms, tips, and more. We make sure they are not working out incorrectly. </li>

<li>A potential harmful effect of our website is that the user may not actually make much progress in the gym because they think "the bulk of the work" is done just by looking at the website. There isn't much motivation in our website just information</li>
<li>Do to this information people might see overwhelmed with all that they have to do and not even start going to the gym because it seems like too much. However, small steps are very important. </li>

<ul>
<li>One Pro of an internet blocker is to make sure that students stay on tasks at school. Blocking websites means that students are forced to do their work on their computer. However, holding a students hand throughout their life does not teach them much. When internet blockers are put on students don't learn how to make sorrect decisions. It is essentially the school making those decisions for them. The students don't learn how to browse the web responsibly. When they go home they won't have those blockers and they won't know how to control themselves The lack of a admin password allows students to access important information very easily which is a pro. However, a con is that anybody can access this information which can be bad. </li>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>One concern I have about the digital divide is the difference between people of different social classes. Some people may have lots of access to information whilst others may not. With this divide getting bigger these two groups may not be able to relate to each other. Communication may become difficult. People who are used to communicating through the internet may not know how to communicate in person whilst people who don't have tech may not know how to communicate through the internet. both are very important. Another issue about the side with technology is that they stay inside all day and do not enjoy life as much. Our generation has become addicted to our phones to the point where some people don't even know how to commuicate. It causes depression, anxiety, and much more issues. On the other hand the people without technology may have a hard time fitting in with society. Almost every job requires some sort of technology and if they do not have access to it they may not be able to find a job therefore making the gap even bigger. </li>

<li>Accourding to this data, Tik Tok has a much younger demographic and facebook has a much older. This is partly due to multipple reasons. Firslty Tik-Toks content is more directed towards children and Facebook is directed towards adults. Also, Facebook is much older so the people on it are older. I don't think this is harmful because it allows everyone to go to the platform they will enjoy the most. However, it may cause a divide in age demographics and their culture. We may not be able to relate to our parents as much. It is not neccesary to be corrected. It is good business because </li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>Female voices are much softer and soothing. This is good business because the user may feel safer and less stressed with this voice. This doesn't really have to be corrected because it is not harmful. People are able to turn to a male voice. Some would argue however that listening to a women as a virtual assistant woul change view points to seem them as such. 
### Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies</li>
<li>A "for you page" or a "feed page" could influence our decisions. It collects data on which content you like to watch and recomends more of that content. It also gives you adds similar to the content. We will be more inclined to buy these items oppose to random ads. However, people may not be able to learn about other topics and it could divide groups. If you say you are a conservative, you will not see a liberal point of view and it could create a divide. Bias would be made. </li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>The owner does not think this is intentional. He is very light hearted about it and jokes about while still bringing attension to it. He says the computer is racist in a sarcastic tone. He knows that the technology was just not developed correctly. 
### How do you think this happened?</li>
<li>I think this happened because the facial recognition was only tested on white people. So when the computer tried to identify a black person, it couldn't because it was not developed as such. 
### Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Should it be corrected?</li>
<li>Yes this is harmful because it means a whole entire minority is not able to use a feature of this computer. It may hurt the business because blacks won't want to buy a "racist computer." This was not intentional rather a mistake. This has to be corrected to allow these people to use the technology. 
### What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?</li>
<li>To produce a better a better product I would make sure to test the product on on skin tones and then fix it for the blacks. I would also make sure that lighting and position of the face were a contorl group in the testing. </li>

</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overall I learned a lot from this unit. Firstly I learned that bias is a very prominate characteristic in all of us, intentional or not. Some people have racial bias against minorities and other have bias for things such as technology. Both of these are harmful but one is obviously more harmful than the other. However, a technology bias can still hurt. It could lead to irrational decisions that harms the person just because one of them inolves technology. This same theme is evident amongst many topics. As a society we have to learn to eliminate bias or at least reduce it. It could help with production, decisions making, etc. </li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>I could initiate a crowdsource idea in ou environment by maybe doing activities where one person from each group is put into a new group with prople of other groups and they all talk about improving each other projects. Every person has to give everyone else at least one idea. 
### What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?</li>
<li>A crowdsource idea in our enviornment could actually be used with my project. My project is a fitness project. There are two other groups just in my class with fitness websites and probaly more in other classes. If we are able to reach out and share our ideas with each other, all of our projects will benefit. I learned from "Teak Baddies" project and a comment from Mr. Mortenson that we can add a goal system to my project. </li>

<ul>
<li>Some data I could collect during the N@tM is how much everybody likes our features. We could give them a survay to fill out to select what feature they like and what feature needs work or if they would even use the feature. We could also ask them new features they would like to see. With this we can optimize our website to fit the public demand. </li>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>I feel like we should be more careful about PII. If we reveal too much information soemone could take our identity, attack us, or use that information for bad puroses. Of course things like name, country, and credit reports aren't too bad. However, once we give away more personal information such as drivers license number, SS number, and names of reletives it can be dangerous. </li>

<ul>
<li>A good password would be a name of a pet followed by some number that is personal to you and only you know such as Sammy2414. A bad password would be one that is easily guessed such as 12345678, or one that has accesible information about you such as your instagram username. </li>

<ul>
<li>A phishing scheme I have learned is people pretending to be some official such as a member of a credit card company to achieve sensetive information. I have also seen people send a link that when clicked gives information. Finally I have also seen people make websites that require inforation to sign up and it takes that information. </li>
