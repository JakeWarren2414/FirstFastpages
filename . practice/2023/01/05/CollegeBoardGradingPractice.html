<li>There are a couple differences between my grading and college board. Mine seemed to be a little harder. Whenever a question asked to describe something or give a code segment. I would look at the question and not see anything. However the student cold have explained it elsewhere in their response. Also, I was also a bit confused on where sequencting, selection, and iteration were. I tried to look for it but I had to infer it from the video. </li>
<li>My program will need to be very complex and able to have an important output input, function, and purpose. It can't just be a forum with information. It has to serve a purpose. </li>
<li>The first CPT failed on describing the purpose. It is important on knowing the difference between function and purpose. Purpose is what the goal of the program is. Function is how the function achieves it. A goal could be entertainment and the function could be a card game of some sort. Also this same project did not explain things very well.</li>
