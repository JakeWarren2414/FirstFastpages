    "![Chair](../images/Chair.png)\n",
    "- This chair was made in computer animation. It is quite interesting because it shows how realistic computers can be. Even high school students can make an almost real looking image. It is similar to new technology coming out that can essentially make a human robot. We have chat GDP that you can have a conversation with, we have technology that takes voice clips of someone and makes an ai voice with it, and there is deep fake technology. \n",
