    "- A software library contains procedures that can be used in the creation of new programs.\n",
    "- Existing segments of code can come from internal or external sources, ie. libraries or previously written code.\n",
    "- The use of libraries simplifies the task of creating complex programs.\n",
    "- Application program interfaces (APIs) are specifications for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used.\n",
    "- Documentation for a library or API is necessary in understanding the key behaviors provided by the API/library and how to utilize them in your work.\n",
    "- A library is a collection of code from an external source that can be used to add functionality to a program.\n",
    "- Libraries are very useful, as they can be used to save time and effort in the development process.\n",
    "- Libraries are usually included in a program using a special keyword called \" .\" This keyword tells the program to look for the library and use its code.\n",
    "- Randomization generates a random value beteen two numbers\n",
