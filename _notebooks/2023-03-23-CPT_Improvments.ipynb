    "## Project So Far\n",
    "\n",
    "- Last Trimester I made improvments to my project and met alomost all college board criteria. My project is a sports quiz. It is a quiz where you are asked questions based on your personality and what you want in a sport and then gives you some sports options based on those answers \n",
    "- There are questions like \"do you want to play outside.\" You can either pick yes or no. When you click one of these options it removes certain sports from a list of different sports. It then displays the final list with the removed sports.\n",
    "- There are 6 questions so by the end most sports are removed from the list. There should only be about 2-6 sports at the end based on your questions. \n",
    "- I also have a feature where when you are done with the sports quiz you can use a selection menu and a \"save data\" button to save the data on the website. When you refresh the page it saves and the sport is still on the screen. "

    "- I hope to make sure to fit all of the critera of college board even better\n",
    "    - This will help me make sure to get a good score\n",
    "        - Right now it is debatable if the criteria will fit. \n",
    "    - I can manege complexity better and make my code simpiler\n",
    "    - I havn't tested yet\n",
    "        - I need a video of two different run throughs\n",
    "    - There isn't great iteration\n",
    "        - I want to add a button that says \"redo quiz\"\n",
    "    - My writeup needs a bit more clarification\n",
    "        - Collegeboard may be confused by some of the ways I phrase things\n",
    "- I want to change my list to a database\n",
    "    - The list fits collegeboard criteria for data abstraction however I think that making a database would make it better\n",
    "        - Last trimester I had a hard time understanding backend code however this trimester it is starting to make more sense \n",
    "            - I understand databases more after the CRUD lesson\n",
    "        - With this database I want to add the CRUD functions\n",
    "            - CRUD has started to interest me\n",
    "            - In this database I will have the names of sports \n",
    "                - Every sport will have different properties  \n",
    "                    - Name \n",
    "                    - Id\n",
    "                    - \"Yes\" or \"No\" to variables. Every one of these variables will be linked to a question. Every sport will either be yes or no to each variable. Depending on these variables, the sport will be removed from the list based on these variables.\n",
    "                        - Outside\n",
    "                            - Relates to question on if the user wants to play outside or inside\n",
    "                        - Competitive\n",
    "                            - Relates to question on if the user wants to be competitive or not\n",
    "                        - Team\n",
    "                            - Relates to question on if the user wants to be on a team or not\n",
    "                        - Running\n",
    "                            - Relates to question on if the user wants to run or not\n",
    "                        - Contact\n",
    "                            - Relates to question on if the user wants to be in a contact sport or not\n",
    "                        - Ball\n",
    "                            - Relates to question on if the user wants to play with a ball or not or not\n",
    "                        - For example, if basketball is a sport in the database, certain questions will remove it from the database\n",
    "                            - Basketball has a column for team and it says \"yes\" for team\n",
    "                                - If the user selects \"yes\" for team oriented in the quiz then nothing will happen\n",
    "                                - If the user selects \"no\" then basketball would be removed from the database through the delete function\n",
    "                                - I will be able to do this with multiple sports at once. \n",
    "                - I also want to add a create function where people can add a sport to the database\n",
    "                    - They can add a sport like rock climbing to the database and put in its id as RC\n",
    "                        - For every variable or question column they will either put \"no\" or \"yes\"\n",
    "                            - If they do not use this I will clear the garbage and it will use an iteration to force them to put yes or no\n",
    "                            - Every question will now be yes or no\n",
    "                                - This is because the way the sports will be removed from the list is by conditionals\n",
    "                                    - Example: If a user selects \"no\" for playing on a team, then I will use an if statment to remove all sports from the list that have the outside prpery as \"yes\"\n",
