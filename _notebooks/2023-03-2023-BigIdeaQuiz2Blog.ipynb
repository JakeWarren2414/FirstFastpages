    "1. I got question 21 wrong. I put answers C and B when the real answers were B and D. The question was asking for the steps that can be used to identify the desired entry for a spreadsheet. The steps were to find the oldest photographs from the spreadsheet. B was correct because it filtered by photographer to get rid of all the unknown photographers, then it filtered by year to get rid of unknown years like -1. Finally it sorts to find the year. D would be correct because it sorts by year to sort the dates properly then it filters everything out. C and A are incorrect because there is no need to sort by subject. \n",

    "2. I got question 25 wrong. I put D when the correct option is C. The question was asking how much of an increase would 11101000 be from 11101 in binary. I put D because I was thinking in normal number terms and how they go up by 10 every time. Three digits would equal 1000. However, in binary adding 0s just adds an exponent to 2 so 2^3=8\n",
