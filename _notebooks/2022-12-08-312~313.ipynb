    "- A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values.\n",
    "    - May be called \"method\" or \"function\" in different programming languages.\n",
    "- Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values.\n",
    "- To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure\n",
    "- Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there\n",
    "- Return values are \n",
    "- A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value\n",
    "- Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program \n",
    "- Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program\n",
    "- Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use\n",
    "- Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency\n",
    "- Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code\n",
    "- Procedure- a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function\n",
    "- Procedure Name- the name that is given to a function/procedure\n",
    "- Parameters- a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function\n",
    "- Arguments- a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters\n",
