<li>Overall I learned a lot from this presentation. I never really wanted to major in computer science bdfore this. I always knew it was a great paying major but very hard. Quite frankly it isn't exactly what I want to do with my life. However, this presentation overall taught me how valuable of a skill computer sciecne is. Similar to Katherine, I want to major in a finance related field. If this doesn't work out I want to have a backup plan. So maybe in my college carrer I can have a minor in computer science. It will help me with other fields, skills, and give me a possible backup plan. I still need to learn a lot more about what I want to do with my life but this helped me get a better idea. </li>
